    "It would seem from comparing the different schools in this study by size and spending that bigger and better spending does not necessarily equal better student performance. It was interesting to compare the top five best performing schools with the 5 bottom performing schools in one section. The top five performing schools were smaller with fewer students and less overall and per student budgets, and yet, seemed to outperform those schools with more students and a larger overall spending budget. The smaller schools had an overall 93/94% passing math,95-97% passing reading, and an overall passing percent of around 90. The five bottom performing schools were all larger schools with more students and a larger spending budget. Despite the larger spending budgets, these schools only had around a 65% passing math, 81% passing reading, and only an overall 53% passing. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was also interesting to find that the top five best performing schools were all charter schools. I think there would need to be more research done to understand the why of how charter outperformed district if there were reasons separate from school size and budget. I think it would be intersting to also compare class sizes per school or different teaching approaches/programs available to students in those schools that maybe contributed to a better success rate in the charter/smaller schools compared to the district/larger schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, taking what we know from schools in a general sense is that despite smaller budgets, smaller schools have a much better teacher-student ratio in the classroom compared to their larger counterparts where teachers may not be able to better oversee student success. \n"
